# Housing Rights

## Rent Control
For 2025, the most a landlord can increase rent (can increase once every 12 months) is 2.5%. And when they increase rent, they must give you at least 90 days notice. More on this here.

## Appliance Maintenance
O. Reg. 517/06, s. 40 (1). states that appliances supplied by the landlord of the rental unit shall be maintained in a good state of repair and in a safely operable condition. Section 40 (2) states that “appliances” include refrigerators, stoves, clothes washers, clothes dryers, dishwashers, and hot water tanks. 

## Heating
O. Reg. 517/06, s. 15 (1). states that heat shall be provided and maintained so that the room temperature at 1.5 metres above floor level and one metre from exterior walls in all habitable space and in any area intended for normal use by tenants, including recreation rooms and laundry rooms but excluding locker rooms and garages, is at least 20 degrees Celsius.

## Water
O. Reg. 517/06, s. 11 (1) states that every kitchen sink, washbasin, bathtub and shower shall be provided, by safe equipment, with hot and cold running water.
