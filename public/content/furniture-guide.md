# Furniture
Furniture is often very tricky for students to manage, not just because it’s one of the largest expenses, but also because someone will need to take it home at the end of the lease. Below are some great sources to find furniture affordably.

## Facebook Marketplace
**Facebook Marketplace** is an awesome source for second-hand furniture. You can speak to sellers directly, and transactions can be done by cash in-person after delivery to avoid scams. This in-person delivery guarantee prior to cash exchange also gives you the chance to inspect the items. The major downside to this however is that the buyer usually bears the responsibility of pick-up. To avoid issues, we recommend having all of the items on hold one day, and renting a U-Haul to pick all items up together. Kijiji is a similar platform. 

## Jysk
**Jysk** is similar to Ikea, but has locations in London with products of decent quality. For the most part, you can furnish the entire house within a few thousand dollars, which for new furniture, is quite affordable.

## Roadside
Oftentimes, in areas of student single-family homes such as Old North, people will leave furniture they cannot get rid of or sell in their front yard waiting for garbage pick-up. These items are usually in decent condition, and just require some clean-up. So, in April, as students are leaving, you can usually find some decent items for free of cost. 

## Yard Sales
**Yard Sales** are also common in April when students are looking to get rid of their items. You can typically find posters on lightposts or major intersections.
